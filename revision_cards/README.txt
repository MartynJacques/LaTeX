A simple LaTeX template that can be used to create revision/flash cards.

The .tex file contains two template revision cards which should provide enough information to work out the form of the revision cards.

If you use a standard double sided printer, the cards should print correctly with the answers on the back.

Created with inspiration from Todd Davies (GH: Todd-Davies).
